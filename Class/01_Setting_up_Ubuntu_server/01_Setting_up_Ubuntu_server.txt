*) VPS:
    -> virtual private server

*) VPS/server means in digitalOcean is droplets

NOTE: recommended to not login through root user most of the time rather login through added user on server and put strong password for rootUser login 

*) Command:
    -> ssh root@<your_server_id> (initial root user login)
    -> adduser <new_user> (to create non root user)
    -> usermod -a -G sudo <non_root_user_name> (to give access of root-user like privilege)
    -> ssh <new_user>@<your_server_id> (login through new_user)
    -> exit (logout)
    *) Firewall setup:
        -> ufw allow OpenSSH (to allow open ssh)
        -> ufw enable (to active firewall)
    *) To elevate you access to server by other user
        -> first login through that user that we have give access by root-user
        -> sudo su
            -> now you can 'cd root/'
