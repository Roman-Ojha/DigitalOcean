*) LAMP:
    -> Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP

*) Steps:
    -> sudo apt update (to update package list)
    -> sudo apt install apache2 (to install apache2)
    -> sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full" (we are giving permission to apache2 from firewall)
        -> after this if we will search 'http://<droplet_server_ip>/' in browser then we will see the page
    -> sudo ufw status (if you want to see what we have allowed from firewall)
    -> sudo apt install mysql-server (install mysql)
    -> sudo mysql (enter mysql console)
        -> exit (exit from console)
    -> sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql (install php)
        *> php -  installs PHP
        *> libapache2-mod-php - Used by apache to handle PHP files
        *> php-mysql - PHP module that allows PHP to connect to MySQL 
    -> php -v (to check php version)

*) Demonstration:
    -> cd /var/www/html
    -> vim index.html
        -> edit html file
    -> sudo service apache2 restart  (to restart apache2 server)
        -> after this if we will search 'http://<droplet_server_ip>/' in browser then we will see the change that we have done in page
        -> it means that now we can paste our static site using FileZilla to this directory and we can access that site
