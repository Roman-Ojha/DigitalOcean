*) LEMP:
    -> Linux, Nginx(Engine-x), MySQL, PHP

NOTE: recommended is that rather install apache or Nginx in you server
-> so it means that we have to destroy previously install all the stuff
-> we will rebuild digitalocean droplet
    -> go to destroy tab on droplet and rebuild droplet

-> after that:
    -> ssh-keygen -R <host_ip> (to remove all keys belonging to hostname)
        -> OR you can delete \.ssh\known_hosts file from you main pc
    * Now repeat all the process learned in above tutorial to setup droplet (tut_01,tut_02)

*) LEMP install step:
    -> sudo apt update
    -> sudo apt install nginx
    -> sudo ufw app list (to see available app)
    -> sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' (allow nginx over firewall)
    -> sudo apt install mysql-server
 (to install mysql)
    -> sudo mysql (to open mysql console)
    -> sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql (install php)

*) Config/setup:
    -> cd /var/www
    -> cd html
    -> sudo vim index.php
        -> <?php
            echo "hello world";
            ?>
    -> cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
    -> vim default (and edit)
        ->  # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
        index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
        location ~ \.php$ {
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
                include fastcgi_params;
                fastcgi_index index.php;
                fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
    -> sudo service nginx restart
        *> now you can access this php site using digitalocean droplet/vps ip
